# Challenge #4

The solution to the challenge is in `./packages/chain/src/message-box-private.ts` (+ config in runtime.ts).
The tests to the challenge are in `./packages/chain/test/message-box-private.test.ts`

It is based by requirements on `./packages/chain/src/message-box.ts`

To see it in the works run tests `pnpm run test` in `./packages/chain`.

```
npx pnpm install && npx pnpm run build && npx pnpm run test --verbose true
```


## Run it

```
nvm use
pnpm install
```

And then run tests to see the implementation in action:

```
npx pnpm run build && npx pnpm run test --verbose true
```
